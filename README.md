Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, I have Build a Dicision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/AvanishVerma1703/PRODIGY_DS_03/blob/main/bank-additional.csv">Bank_dataset</a>. This repository contains the Bank dataset, which includes customers information and the features attributes such as customers demographics, and Customers behavioral data. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization
- scikit learn



## Dicision Tree Classifier 

During the Dicision Tree Classifier, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a Dicision Tree, Histogram Plot, Count Plot, Plot to Explore the Data and Predict the purchasing Behavioral patterns of the customers. 



## Conclusion

In this project, you effectively leveraged a Decision Tree classifier to analyze and predict customer purchasing behavior. The use of the Bank dataset provided a rich set of features for your model. By successfully implementing this classifier, you can gain insights into which factors influence purchasing decisions, potentially guiding marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.
<br>
Overall, this project showcases your skills in applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets, providing practical insights that can benefit business decisions.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
